    Generate source code from interface definition files.

    To do so, this function leverages type representation and type
    support generation support as provided by third-party package
    extensions.

    Each path to an interface definition file is a relative path optionally
    prefixed by another path followed by a colon ':', against which the first
    relative path is to be resolved.

    The directory structure that these relative paths exhibit will be replicated
    on output (as opposed to the prefix path, which will be ignored).

    If no type representation nor type support is specified, all available ones
    will be generated.

    If more than one type representation or type support is generated, the
    name of each will be appended to the given `output_path` to preclude
    name clashes upon writing source code files.
